Design System: TaskPulse

This folder houses the core design assets and guidelines for the TaskMaster task management application. TaskMaster's design system aims to deliver a streamlined, intuitive, and visually pleasing user experience across all platforms.

Key Design Principles

Clarity: Emphasis on clear visual hierarchy, concise labeling, and unambiguous actions.
Efficiency: Prioritizing ease of navigation, quick task creation, and uncluttered information display.
Aesthetics: A modern and polished look utilizing a balanced color palette, subtle gradients, and considered typography.
Accessibility: Focus on appropriate color contrast, sufficient font sizes, and responsiveness for a variety of devices and screen resolutions.
Folder Structure

components/
Contains individual UI component designs (buttons, input fields, task cards, navigation elements, etc.).
Each component has its own folder with:
Design files (.sketch, .fig, .xd)
Image assets (.png, .svg)
Component documentation (.txt or .md) outlining states (default, hover, disabled), variants, and basic usage.
layouts/
Houses screen-level layout designs and wireframes.
Includes key screens such as:
Dashboard view (overview of tasks)
Project-specific views
Individual task view
Settings and profile screens
mockups/
Contains high-fidelity mockups representing various use-cases and user journeys.
styles/
colors.scss: Definition of the primary color palette, secondary palettes, and semantic color usage.
typography.scss: Specification of font families, sizes, weights, and line-heights.
spacing.scss: Definition of consistent spacing units and padding guidelines.
icons.svg: Library of all icons used throughout the application.
Design Workflow

Ideation: Collaborative brainstorming, low-fidelity wireframing (hand-drawn or using tools like Balsamiq)
Mid-Fidelity Wireframes: Detailed layout structure, navigation flows (created in Figma, Sketch, or similar tools).
High-Fidelity Design: Polished UI, applying design system components, colors, and styles.
Prototyping: Linking screens in tools like InVision or Principle to simulate interactions and user flows.
Usability Testing: Gathering feedback from target users on design effectiveness and intuitive functionality.
Version Control

This design folder utilizes Git for version control and collaboration.

Branching: Use feature branches for specific component or screen updates.
Commits: Clear and descriptive commit messages.
Pull Requests: Review and approval process before merging changes into the main branch.
Contribution Guidelines

Refer to the existing design system and component documentation before creating new elements.
Strive for consistency and maintainability.
Submit detailed design descriptions and rationales with any proposed changes.
Engage in collaborative reviews to ensure alignment with the application's overall design direction.
